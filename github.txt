This month, we focused on the popular code hosting platform GitHub. We learned about how to use GitHub to host our Git repositories and collaborate with other developers. We explored the different features of GitHub, such as issues, pull requests, and project boards. We also learned about how to create and manage GitHub repositories and how to use GitHub's collaboration features. Additionally, we discussed GitHub's integration with other tools and services and how it can be used to streamline our development workflow.
