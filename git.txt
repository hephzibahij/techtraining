During this month, we explored the version control system Git. We learned about how Git works and how it can help us manage our codebase effectively. We explored the different Git commands, such as git init, git add, git commit, and git push. We also learned about branching and merging in Git and how they can help us collaborate with other developers. Additionally, we discussed the concept of remote repositories and how we can use Git to collaborate with others. Finally, we learned about common Git workflows and best practices for using Git effectively.
