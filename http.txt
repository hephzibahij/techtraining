In this month's session, we focused on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the backbone of the World Wide Web. We learned about how HTTP works and how it is used to transmit data between clients and servers. We explored the different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, and DELETE, and how they are used to perform different actions on the web. Additionally, we discussed the concept of RESTful web services and how HTTP is used to create APIs. Finally, we learned about the different HTTP status codes and what they mean.
